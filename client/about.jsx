              Our current understanding of physics and current technology allows information to travel at the maximum limit of the speed of light (~300km/s).
              <span />
              That means for communicating with spacecraft
              and space colonies on Mars, the fastest ONE-WAY communication is 182 seconds at
              the closest approach and 1,342 seconds at the farthest approach with an average
              of 751 seconds (source: space.com).

              This poses a real problem for using current networking
              protocols used on Earth such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).
              <span />
              For example, each packet of information sent
              using TCP is error-checked and an acknowledgement is sent back to the sender.
              <span />
              Additionally, each packet of information does
              not generally contain the total information.
              <span />
              If one packet of information is missing the entire data may be rendered
              meaningless.

            <p className="MsoNormal"><b>Bandwidth:</b></p>

            <p className="MsoNormal">
              Current communications with spacecraft involve using the
              Deep Space Network (DSN). This is a ground-based system with transceivers in Goldstone,
              California; Madrid, Spain; Canberra, Australia.
              <span />
              They are roughly 120 longitudinal degrees apart to maintain constant
              communications with spacecraft as the world turns no matter where they are in
              space.
              Communications are on the 7-8
              Gigahertz range (X-band).
              With
              increasing RF spectrum use and the fact that more information can be
              transmitted at higher frequencies, a higher frequency for future spacecraft is important.
              <span />
              But legacy spacecraft such as the Voyager
              spacecrafts still need to be supported.

              To increase bandwidth, NASA is working on using Lasers to

              Using
              lasers from the ground pose additional challenges.

              A communications laser dedicated to space
              network in an Earth orbit could overcome some of those challenges.

              As you will be able to see from this demonstration, at
              certain points in time Earth and Mars do not have a direct line of site due to
              being on opposite sides of the Sun.
              <span />
              During this time period, communication is not possible.
              <span />
              With the demonstration, you will be able to
              see how adding additional satellites as relays to the system affect
              performance.

              video conferencing, social media, education, file transfers, and more.

            <p className="MsoNormal">
              Some problems with speed are solved on Earth using Content
              Delivery Networks (CDNs).
              CDNs cache
              information so that the content is closer to the user thereby reducing the
              transport speed.
              A similar approach can
              be made using satellites in between Earth and Mars and/or adding additional
              functionality on orbiters and extending the network further into the solar
              system.
